# PortScanner - Python

It's simple port scanner written in python. Before it starts scanning it shows you your public IP and some information about it.

for example:

python3 port_scanner.py -u [host] -p [port range] -o [file to save]

Write the host input like google.com or github.com. Urls like https://google.com/...... are currently not supported.
The port range should look like 20-50 and the output is currently just in a normal .txt file.

It's only for educational purposes. You are not allowed to scan ports of a host or network if you have no permission from the owner. I am not liabe for any illegal uses of this program. You need the permission of the network/host owner!
